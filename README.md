# hello-world
searching for greatness

Hey people! I am a 48 years old lawyear from Mexico, who always try to learn everything new.

In this case, coding, but not 100% new because a LOT of years ago I learned Clipper and totally loved it

Now I am reading a book about C++, a book to learn Python (yes, both at same time) and want to start learning HTML right away too because I need to create a web page for my business.

nice to be here, cheers!
